		`
		The scholarly literature is a vast store of formalized human knowledge, interconnected by citations between publications. 
		Looking at these citations is one way to measure the influence of scholarly research. 
		<a href="http://scholar.eigenfactor.org/" target="_blank">Scholar.eigenfactor.org</a> 
		is a collection of tools I built to use citations to measure and visualize the influence of collections of papers. 
		These collections can represent, for example, individual scholars, or journals, academic departments, or fields of study.

		`
		Community detection, or clustering, algorithms can reveal patterns and relationships in complex citation networks. These algorithms are computationally difficult, however, and with the continually increasing number of publications, the challenge is to adapt these algorithms to very large networks. Using several parallel processing techniques, I am able to perform <a href="http://www.mapequation.org/code.html" target="_blank">Infomap</a> clustering on networks with hundreds of millions of publications and over 1 billion citation links.

		"img": require('./assets/images/dendrogram_mathjargon_thumb.jpg'),
		"description": 
		`
		We analyze the mathematical language used in hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, comparing the use of math across different disciplines. 
		By comparing the distributions of mathematical symbols and terms across fields, we quantify the "jargon barriers" between these fieldsâ€”the difficulty any two fileds might have communicating based on how different their use of mathematical language is. 
		We find that characterizing fields by their use of mathematical language causes them to group in intuitive ways, and we explore how this approach could be used for recommendations in the scholarly literature, and for helping to bridge knowledge gaps in science.

		As a <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good</a>
